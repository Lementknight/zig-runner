//! Problem matchers: turning a step's output into annotations, as GitHub's runner does.
//!
//! An action registers one with `::add-matcher::<path to json>` and withdraws it with
//! `::remove-matcher owner=<name>::`. The file holds one or more matchers:
//!
//!     { "problemMatcher": [ { "owner": "tsc", "severity": "error", "pattern": [
//!         { "regexp": "^([^\\s].*)\\((\\d+),(\\d+)\\): (error|warning) TS(\\d+): (.*)$",
//!           "file": 1, "line": 2, "column": 3, "severity": 4, "code": 5, "message": 6 } ] } ] }
//!
//! A matcher's `pattern` is a *list*, and that is the part worth understanding: the patterns match
//! **consecutive lines**. `actions/setup-node`'s eslint-stylish matcher has two — the first catches
//! a filename on its own line, the second each error beneath it — and the second carries
//! `"loop": true`, so it matches as many following lines as it can. Values captured by earlier
//! patterns are carried forward, which is how an error line that mentions no filename still gets
//! one. A line that breaks the sequence resets it, and is then retried as a first pattern.
//!
//! The regular expressions come from `regex.zig`, which reads them as GitHub's runner does (.NET,
//! ECMAScript mode). A pattern it refuses (a balancing group, `(?<a-b>…)`) makes **that matcher**
//! inert with a warning, not the step fail: an action should lose its annotations, not its job.
